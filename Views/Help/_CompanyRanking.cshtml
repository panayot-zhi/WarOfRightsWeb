        Company Ranking
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        IMPORTANT: During battle, the authority and orders of the commanding officers <u>are not debatable</u>. Critique is welcome, but only after the battle has ended. We either succeed as a whole unit or die to the very last man.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Recruit
    </h3>
    <p>
        A candidate for the company. An enlisted man in the army who held the lowest rank. 
        To advance from this rank a recruit should pass a shooting test in which 
        they are required to hit the inner circle of the farthest target (at 125 yards) in the drill camp's shooting range 3 consecutive times.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Private
    </h3>
    <p>
        The backbone of the company, the private's job is to obey orders which usually involves forming lines, and marching to a more favorable position in order to maximize their firepower.
        Our privates are trained hard in the sense that they would deal as much damage as possible towards the rebels. We encourage all team members to give information and suggestions, 
        but to always obey the commanding officer's orders even if they seem counter intuitive.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Corporal
    </h3>
    <p>
        A corporal is a role-model for his comrades.
        They frequently succeed in the responsibilities of sergeants in his absence, and should therefore be familiar with his duties.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Sergeant
    </h3>
    <p>
        One of the most iconic ranks in military history. The sergeant would lead by example towards his men and push them to their limits. 
        The sergeant was also in charge of a small section of soldiers called a platoon. He had the authority to shoot any who dared go against “his”
        orders or orders from a higher rank.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Colour Sergeant
    </h3>
    <p>
        The colour sergeant had the honorary responsibility of holding and protecting the colours of the regiment. The colour sergeant would be looked upon to rally and inspire men during engagements.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        1<small>st</small> Sergeant
    </h3>
    <p>
        The first sergeant is is a senior non-commissioned officer. He had the same responsibilities as any other sergeant.
        He was even tougher on his men and would not hesitate to shoot a man who presented cowardice.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Sergeant Major
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ Sergeant major has more control over a first sergeant. However, if they were absent it was a first sergeant who had to step up. A sergeant major
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        2<small>nd</small> Lieutenant
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ The second lieutenant typically command four squads if the first lieutenant was absent in the chain of command. The second lieutenant is often chosen carefully.
    </p>

    <h3>
        1<small>st</small> Lieutenant
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ Also commanded four squads. If they're absent, it's the second lieutenants job. These men were quite experienced and trusted by their captains. A captain depends on his Lieutenant's.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Captain
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ A captain leads a company. Every company has a captain or else it isn't a company. He typically commanded two squads directly, and the rest was on his lieutenants. That is why lieutenants are in charge of four squads.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Major
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ When a colonel fell a major came into action to replace him. In the Civil War officers were falling constantly so there was always someone to replace the next man up. Otherwise there was no way to keep up with a gory battle!
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Lieutenant Colonel
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ A lieutenant colonel leads the whole damn battalion. He probably has the most of experienced on a gory battlefield. As the leader of a battalion, he commands the regiments. Regiments are made up of companies. Lieutenant colonel's have a lot on their back.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Colonel
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ The colonel commanded two companies directly. He could command any two companies in a regiment. He definitely had a say over his captains.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        General
    </h3>
    <p>
        @*TODO: Revise this*@ The general, leads the whole army. He tells the lieutenant colonel, and the colonel makes things happen. Nobody questions the general because he is the "god" of war.
