        {
            { NewYork52nd, "Made up primarily of hardy Germans from the streets of New York City, six companies of the “German Rangers: and another four of the “Sigel Rifles” banded together to form the fifty-second regiment, which along with the seventh NY formed the only all-German units in the Second Corps, fighting alongside the Irish Brigade." },
            { LouisianaZouaves1st, "Originating out of the city of New Orleans, the “Pelican State” sent almost the full thousand men needed to fill the regiment before they were shipped under the command of Colonel Blanchard to the Eastern front, where the end of the war saw them combined into a brigade that surrendered with less than four-hundred men." },
            { Pennsylvania6th, "The 6th PA, headed by Colonel Richard Rush, was also proud to be called &quot;Rush's Lancers&quot; for the use of 9 foot long lances early in the war. Rush had graduated the same year as McClellan, who originally recommended his old friend to adopt the iconic weapons, though they weren't liked by the troops. The 6th served mostly as HQ guards and partaking in small skirmishes before adopting the Sharps Carbine in 1863, just in time for some heavy fighting in the Gettysburg campaign, and continuing to serve valiantly through the end of the war." },
            { Pennsylvania4th, "Early US efforts at the commencement of the Civil War for outfitting cavalry was slow and painful, where many weren't issued sabers, let alone horses. The 4th PA were formed in this early period from Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburg, where by March 1862 only six of the companies were outfitted with mounts." },
            { NCSharpshooters1st, "The 1st North Carolina Battalion Sharpshooters was organized at Gordonsville, Virginia in May of 1862 with two companies from the 21st North Carolina Regiment. The men of Company A, 1st battalion, under the command of Captain Nathan G. Hunt were some of the first skirmishers to be engaged at Sharpsburg." },
            { Texas1st, "The ten companies worth of men came from Texas and were organized in Richmond, VA when the war began. They fought hard and fast in many locations, but paid the heavy price for doing so, losing eighty-two percent of their unit in one of those engagements alone while fighting to retake Miller's Cornfield." },
            { Georgia2nd, "The 2nd Battalion GA Sharpshooters were one of many sharpshooting regiments raised in the South in response to similar regiments in the North. The men were taken from the crack shots of several existing infantry regiments by order of Brig. Gen. William Smith, who foresaw the need for such units in the coming war." },
            { Mississippi2nd, "The 2nd Mississippi were involved from the very beginning of the war, and were with General Bee when he made his rallying proclamation, “Look, men! There is Jackson standing like a stone wall!”. The regiment was devastated by enemy fire several times and barely escaped with their flag and lives at Petersburg." },
            { Arkansas3rd, "Those of the 3rd Arkansas were eager to engage in the war as it began even with just two companies to their name, but it wasn't until Senator Albert Rust pledged to raise the remainder of the regiment that they were allowed in by the Confederate Army, and served throughout the entire Eastern theater." },
            { Virginia5th, "This regiment was first raised out of the iconic and war-torn Harper's Ferry, and was commanded by Major General Kenton Harper, who was commander of all Virginia militias before the start of the war. It was also a member of the famous “Stonewall Brigade,” but was personally known as the “Fighting Fifth.”" },
            { Alabama6th, "The 6th were organized and mustered at Montgomery, Alabama with over 1,400 men separated into 12 companies, under the command of Colonel John Seibels. They served in many important campaigns throughout the entirety of the war, and earned the respect of their brethren due to a fierce fighting reputation." },
            { SouthCarolina12th, "While Jefferson Davis made a call for volunteers, the ranks of the 12th swelled as the war initially loomed. Their rebellious leanings did not prevent them from wearing blue coats “liberated” from Harper's Ferry while fighting at Antietam, where the Union thought they were reinforcements until too late." },
            { NorthCarolina27th, "Originally formed as the 9th North Carolina, several months after it was instead reformed as the 27th. It fought in many different battles, but with such hard fighting by the time the war had drawn to a close, only nine officers and one-hundred and three enlisted were present to surrender at Appomattox." },
            { Virginia33rd, "The 33rd Virginia Infantry were for the majority of the war, proud members of the “Stonewall Brigade,” and due to their early preference for wearing blue uniforms were at First Manassas mistaken for friendly troops by a Union artillery battery, which allowed them to capture the entire battery." },
            { Minnesota1st, "Governor Ramsey of Minnesota happened to be present as President Lincoln received news of the fall of Fort Sumter, immediately offering the services and manpower of his newfound state to put down the rebellion. They almost completely sacrificed themselves to buy time for other units at Gettysburg to reform." },
            { UnitedStates2nd, "The 2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment was a regiment originally from the regular army that had served since the inception of the nation.

Most of the Washington Artillery Batteries were later captured in the fall of Mobile, Alabama in 1865. The batteries are now survived by the 141st Field Artillery Regiment." },
            { BatteryPelham, "Horse artillery, or “flying artillery” as they had been called twenty years prior, was a form of artillery becoming increasingly popular in American military tactics, ans John Pelham for the Confederate side was one of its chief proponents. Pelham’s well-drilled team of the Newtown Artillery caught J.E.B. Stuart’s eye, from whence they were brought under his command with more horses to convert them into this new and dangerous form. Serving with distinction, Pelham and the renamed Stuart Horse Artillery, 1st Battery ably served from the beginning, and were commanded by the newly appointed Captain James Breathed given Pelham’s ascension to Chief of Artillery for Stuart. Their former commander would fall tragically as he took part in a charge at the Battle of Kelly’s Ford." },
            { BatteryPoague, "The men of the 1st Rockbridge Artillery named the battery after the county from which they came from when they organized at Lexington in April 1861, and served in most every battle of the war. When William Pendleton took over command from the VMI professor who first created the unit, the former Episcopal priest named the battery’s four guns “Matthew,” Mark,” Luke” and “John,” and went on to be attached to the “Stonewall Brigade” in the First Battle of Manassas. In the ensuing Union retreat, the battery was upgraded with larger guns and in the Battle of Sharpsburg were able to help in the defense of Dunker Church and the northern end of Lee’s left flank." },

Their commander, John P.W. Read, had been a captain in the Georgia Hussars State Militia for seven years prior to the outbreak of hostilities, and he joined his men faithfully as they were equipped with cannon in March 1862 instead of the Enfields or Springfields they had originally hoped for. By the time of the Maryland Campaign, the battery had four different styles of guns that were put to work equally on the Maryland Heights as well as on the field of Antietam, though the axle for their Ordinance Rifle broke prior to the latter battle." },
            { BatteryReily, "The 1st North Carolina Artillery had a number of batteries in its structure, including Battery D, also known as the “Rowan Artillery,” after the county from which most of its artillerymen hailed. They were led by Captain James Reilly as they defended the town of Sharpsburg to the best of their ability, helping to beat back the IX Corps from destroying Lee’s right flank. However, they and the other companies which were part of the ANV, did not weather the war well, as only one man was left to represent the unit when the army surrendered at Appomattox. Their brethren in the odd companies which served in the Army of the Tennessee fared little better, as by the end of the war those companies which hadn’t disbanded had been turned into infantry, which in turn were either captured or disbanded as well by 1865." },

Begun first as militia in 1838, they were quick to once again hearken to their state’s banner when the Civil War broke out, mustering in Lafayette Square in May of 1861. Like several other distinguished units, they continued their own tradition of excellence throughout the early war, and at the Battle of Sharpsburg they aided the Confederate attempts to defend the lower bridge for several hours against multiple charges and despite the counter operations of the Union artillery. Most of the Washington Artillery Batteries were later captured in the fall of Mobile, Alabama in 1865. The batteries are now survived by the 141st Field Artillery Regiment." },

The battery was engaged in battles early into the War, being included in campaigns with the Army of the Northwest prior to being attached to the Army of Northern Virginia. It wasn’t until the army reorganization of April, 1862 that Captain Wooding took command, where at the Battle of Sharpsburg his battery was stationed atop Nicodemus Hill. From there they withered Federal ranks of infantry with deady flanking fire before they were forced to retreat due to Federal gains farther south and west. However, they themselves took heavy casualties through the rest of the war in turn. By Appomattox, only four officers and seventy-nine men survived to the day of surrender." },

Originally mustered in 1821, much of the 4th US had been stationed out in the midwestern territories prior to the outbreak of war, and were soon consolidated to the defense of the capital once they returned in October of 1861. Their first engagement against fellow countrymen was at Orange Court House in July of 1862, and performed valiant rear-guard actions during the retreat of the Peninsula Campaign. At Antietam, the Captain Campbell and the 4th US acted with gusto in the thickest of fighting on the Hagerstown Pike, where Campbell and many of his men were wounded or killed as they manned the guns. They continued to serve in an uncountable number of battles throughout their distinguished service." },

The battery was attached to the regular regiment, which had existed since 1821, and saw their first action less than a year later in March of 1862 at the Battle of Kernstown. At the time of the battle of Antietam, their battery was situated on a hill close to Burnside Bridge, first shelling Rebel units north of the town, and then shifting its attention to the bridge defenders as the Union assaults took place. Their commander, Captain Clark, was wounded by the same shrapnel shell that killed his lieutenant and an enlisted man as the battery advanced with the I Corps in the fields west of the Lower Bridge. The battery continued to act meritoriously throughout the rest of the war, eventually being attached to Sheridan’s Reserve Horse Artillery until the end of the war." },
            { BatteryCook, "Captain Asa Cook was in command of a mostly green unit when the battle at Antietam began, having only mustered in the unit three months prior out of North Cambridge and barely seen action at the battles of Bull Run and Chantilly. What’s more, their premier casualties weren’t even a result of the battlefield, but a result of a train accident as they left their mustering ground. However, the battery served well at both South Mountain and Antietam, in the latter case assisting in attacking the defenders across the Lower Bridge. It then advanced with the rest of the infantry in moving west and north, including the fighting around the Sherrick and Otto farmsteads. They handled their James Rifles and 12-lb Howitzers readily, even managing to capture a contingent of cavalry recruits prior to their mustering out from their six-month service." },

However, in July of 1862 Durell was promoted to Lt. Colonel, and was replaced by Captain Cooper for the remainder of the war. Prior to Antietam, the unit had been engaged in several battles, and so were not new to their duties when the fighting in Maryland began. The battery was close behind the PA Reserves that engaged the Confederates late on the 16th, and joined various batteries on Joseph Poffenberger’s ridge to help defend the western approaches for the northern flank of the Army the following day.  Cooper himself narrowly avoided death while he directed his battery, as solid shot hit his horse, tearing it to pieces, while he remained mostly unscathed." },

In late 1861 their use of untrained mules earned them the nickname of the “Jackass Battery.” During the Battle of South Mountain, Lt. Crome was sent forward with a section of guns by the commander, Captain James McMullin, within forty yards of the enemy defenses on the Wood Road. Unfortunately for the artillerymen, they quickly drew fire and were plucked off in quick succession, forcing even Lt. Crome to man the guns. The Lt. and his men were able to fire several rounds of double canister at the Rebels, and even repulsed a charge against them, however Crome was hit by a wound to his chest. The guns were abandoned, and the Lieutenant passed several hours later, but their sacrifice meant the pushing out of the Rebels from their strong position." },

After forming in September of 1861, they were first saw action at Second Bull Run, but Gerrish was wounded and captured. Captain Frederick Edgell then took command at Antietam, where early the morning of the 17th they exchanged counter-battery fire in the far north as the rest of the I Corps marched far to their south into the Cornfield, and then moved to join them in the assault against the Confederate positions at Dunker Church. Edgell’s men of the Granite State continued to serve honorably throughout most every engagement of the Army of the Potomac for the rest of the war." },

The men had traveled from Kentucky and met at Pendleton, Ohio to become Company E of the 1st Kentucky Infantry, but soon broke off to become a battery of light artillery instead. They soon joined the Kanawha Division, aiding in the defense of the newly created state of West Virginia, while at South Mountain a section of their guns commanded by Lt. Daniel Glassie made effective fire from their position near the Wise House against the Confederate defenses until they ran out of water to swab the hot barrels.

As the war threatened on the horizon in early 1861, the battery was stationed at Fort Duncan in January, and Fort Taylor a month later, but by early 1862 they had been moved to Washington. They were engaged in many skirmishes and battles before Antietam, where they were integral to the Union defense of the Sunken Road once it had been taken, but was forced to retire as longer ranged rifled cannons began to wither down their numbers. General Richardson was commanding the battery personally as one of those enemy shells mortally wounded him. During the rest of the war they continued to take part in many major battles of the eastern front." },

However, as manpower dwindled, many regiments were also trained as infantry so that, as circumstances required, they could be pulled from garrisons and added to armies directly as more infantry. The 5th NY Heavy Artillery served as garrison since their consolidation and creation in March of 1862, and defended various forts in New York Harbor and Baltimore before being sent to Harper’s Ferry. As the Confederates surrounded the town in September, 1862, three of the 5th’s heavy guns anchored the far right flank of the Union defenses on Bolivar Heights, guarding the approach along the Potomac.

Within a few months, however, the regiment was seeing service in the thick of fighting among several Virginian battlefields. Both at Crampton’s Gap and at Antietam, Hexamer’s 10lb Parrotts were integral with their long range bombardment at countering Lee’s artillery and weakening the Rebel defensive points. At Antietam particularly, they silenced several Rebel batteries around Dunker Church, and also provided cover fire against the Rebels near the Piper Farm. They continued to fight in many major operations throughout the rest of the war before being mustered out in June of 1865." },

Of the four batteries raised, Battery C was commanded by Captain Robert Langner, and their four 20lb-Parrott rifles played an important role in several battles through to 1863. At Antietam itself, Langner and his men kept the Confederate army in check from their position near the Pry House, their heavy guns adding to the “artillery hell” described by Col. Stephen Lee. In 1863, the battalion was split apart, with Battery C becoming the 31st New York Independent Light Artillery which served for another year and a half before mustering out." },

Ezra Matthews had served the army well in several battles prior to the commencement of the Maryland Campaign. At Antietam, Matthews’ battery was right in the center of the action throughout the entire morning, both defending and attacking in the fields north of the bloody Miller’s Cornfield. As other batteries came forward and retreated in turn, Battery F held their position and provided supportive fire throughout the fighting on the northern end of the battlefield. Following the battle, they aided in the search for Lee’s army during its retreat, but Capt. Matthews fell ill, and Lt. Robert Ricketts would take over command for the rest of the war." },
