After stints in the defense of Washington D.C. and numerous expeditions with Burnside into the North Carolina islands, the 89th first felt the whiz of bullets at the Battle of South Mills, but it wasn't until the Maryland Campaign that they really felt the heat of battle. After losing several men at South Mountain, it was at Antietam that the 89th were one of several tasked with crossing Snavely's Ford south of the Lower Bridge, turning Toombs' right flank and helping force him away from the bridge. The 89th continued to serve with honor and distinction with the AotP throughout the remainder of the war.</Data></Cell>

In the midst of June, 1861, the regiment was moved by train up to Lynchburg, VA to be attached to General Ewell's Confederate Army of the Potomac stationed near Fairfax Station and Manassas. Not seeing much of the actions at First Manassas, their true test came during the Shenandoah Campaign, after the regiment was reassigned to William Walker's Brigade, and Walker was replaced by the inexperienced Harry Hays, son-in-law to President Jefferson Davis. The 6th took heavy casualties, including the death of then-commander Colonel Strong.

A section of Captain Pottsâ men were sent to the town of Sandy Hook where they battled with the Confederate forces for two days, and then came back to join their brethren in trying to counter the enemy batteries on Loudon and Maryland Heights from their position on Camp Hill. Following their parole after the surrender, they returned as Company F of the 32nd for a short while before they were split apart and apportioned to various units.</Data></Cell>

The day prior to the main battle, they briefly dueled with an enemy battery near Dunker Church, and on the day of the battle were personally brought forward by General Hooker himself to their position just north of Millerâs Cornfield. They were front and center when Hoodâs men were pushing through the cornfield. Despite the infantry around them retreating back, they managed to not only hold their position, but they were able to stop the Rebel advance by the grace of their double canister.</Data></Cell>

Unfortunately it took until May of 1862 before they were fully outfitted with all six of their Ordnance Rifles, and unique in getting the first six consecutively-numbered guns from the armory line. At Antietam, the Reynolds battery was part of the assault against the Confederates by providing long range fire from the plowed field north of the infamous Millerâs Cornfield.
